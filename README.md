# top-100-crypto-price-list
This is the simple react native app which shows the prices of top 100 cryptocurrencies. It uses reduxtoolkit for managing the state.
I have used the open api from https://api.coingecko.com/api/v3/coins/markets?vs_currency=usd to get the prices of cryptocurrencies

```
git clone git@github.com:sumukus/top-100-crypto-price-list.git myApp
cd myApp
npm i
npx expo start
```
